# Arctica Media Player

The Arctica Media Player brings back performant media player experience to remote (Linux based) desktop sessions.

## Installation

There is nothing really to install, except from a test version.

So brave test users may dive in deeper [by studying the ArcticaMediaplayer documentation](https://github.com/ArcticaProject/ArcticaDocs/blob/master/ArcticaMediaplayer).
